# 6. Application

At this stage, project simulates a simple operation of an ecommerce store, which houses the following:
- User & Cart (decoupled, a Cart can exist without a User, if not logged in)
- Product & Group (decoupled Products can belong to certain product Groups (1 group per product type), 
and Groups can exist without any products attached to them)
- Order (build based on a passed Cart)

Further development of the application can include the following:
- User logging in and out, with User's details being stored in the DB for easier Order completion
- Order class expansion to include user details required to issue an invoice
